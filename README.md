## Overview
Automated log monitoring and analysis workflow combining Bash scripting and Python. This project demonstrates systematic approaches to log collection, parsing, analysis, and alerting for security monitoring and compliance purposes.

## Objectives
- Develop automated log collection and aggregation
- Create log parsing and analysis pipelines
- Implement real-time alerting for security events
- Generate compliance and audit reports
- Enable rapid incident investigation capabilities

## Methodology
- Centralized log collection and storage
- Log parsing and normalization
- Event correlation and pattern detection
- Alert rule development and tuning
- Automated report generation
- Integration with security monitoring systems

## Key Findings
- Effective log processing techniques
- Common security event patterns
- Alert tuning and false positive reduction
- Log retention and compliance requirements
- Performance optimization for large-scale deployments

## Technologies Used
- Bash scripting - Log processing automation
- Python - Advanced parsing and analysis
- Regular expressions - Log pattern matching
